#PROJECT PYPLOT

Thanks to RCSB, PyProt, Biostar, mySQLdb, Stack Overflow, PyMol, Python.org and of course Google.

Project PyPlot is a simple implementation of multiple libraries made using the language Python. It connects to the mySQL database and using the link in the database, downloads the pdb file and renders it in PyMol software. It further displays several information related to the protein.

P.S. All the PyProt Modules used are the standalone versions obtained from their Github Repo. A sample pdb file 3NXY.pdb is added to the repository from the RCSB PDB for testing purposes. The educational version of PyMol has been used to make and present this project.


P.P.S: For an advanced explantion: Please refer to the pdf in this repository.
